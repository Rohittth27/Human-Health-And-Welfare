<p>Infectious diseases are a diverse group of illnesses caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites, that can invade the body and disrupt its normal functioning. These diseases can be transmitted from person to person, through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, or via vectors like mosquitoes or ticks. The study and understanding of infectious diseases are critical in the fields of medicine, public health, and epidemiology, as they play a significant role in shaping human health and have been a focal point of scientific research and healthcare efforts throughout history. </p>

<p>Common Infectious Diseases in Human</p>
<p>Pathogen:Pathogens are the parasites that enter the human body through various means, then multiply, and interfere with normal vital activities.</p>
<p>Types Of Infectious Diseases</p>
<ol><li>Bacterial Diseases</li>
<p>Bacteria are prokaryotic, unicellular microorganism that are found everywhere.
Bacteria are found in the soil, water and air. Bacteria are also found on human skin and in the digestive tract.</p>
<ul><li>Bacteria can enter other body systems and cause infections or disease.</li>
<li>Bacteria can enter the body through a cut in the skin, the respiratory tract or the digestive tract.</li></ul>

</ul>
<li>Viral Diseases</li>
<P>A Virus is a small particle that contains proteins and heredity material (DNA or RNA), but is not alive.</p>
<ul><li>The virus is surrounded by a protein coat, or capsid.</li>
<li>A virus particle can not eat, metabolize food and can only reproduce inside a cell.</li>
<li>Outside the cell, the virus particle does nothing and remains inactive.</li></ul>

</div>
</div>
</section>
<li>Fungal Diseases</li>
<p>Any disease caused by a fungus.
A fungus that invades the tissue can cause a disease that's confined to the skin, spreads into tissue, bones and organs or affects the whole body.
Symptoms depend on the area affected, but can include skin rash or vaginal infection resulting in abnormal discharge.
Treatments include antifungal medication.</p>

</div>
</div>
</section>
<li>Protozoan Diseases</li>
<p>Protozoan's are unicellular or colonial organisms.Many animal-like and fungus-like protests can cause human diseases including African sleeping sickness, malaria and yellow fever.
Some protists require an animal intermediate, such as a mosquito, to enter the body.
Sometimes protists enter the body through the digestive tract from contaminated food or water.</p>

<li>Vector - Female Anopheles mosquito.</li>
<li>Symptoms -Head aches, muscle pain, high fever. During fever the patient feels chill and shivering.</li>
<li>Mode of spread-This disease spreads by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquito. Only the female Anopheles is capable of spreading the disease because it sucks the blood of man.</li>

<p>AIDS</p>
<p>AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome),Caused by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) [HIV is a retrovirus (RNA virus)].</p>
<p>Diagnosis of AIDS :- By ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay).</p>
<p>Treatment:- No permanent cure; antiretroviral therapies can prolong the life of patient.</p>
<p>Transmission of HIV occurs through</p>
<section class="container">
<div class ="new">
<div class="image">
<img SRC="./HIV.png" height="300" width="500">
</div>
<div class="con">
<ul><li>Sexual contact with infected person.</li>
<li>Sharing infected needles (as in case of intravenous drug abusers).</li>
<li>Transfusion of contaminated blood Infected mother to child through placenta.</li></ul>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<P>Time lag between infection and appearance of symptoms - Few months to many years (5-10 years).</p>
<p>How does AIDS infection spread?</p>
<ul><li>When HIV virus enters the host cell, the virus enters into macrophages, where RNA replicates and forms viral DNA by the help of enzyme reverse transcriptase.</li>
<li>The viral DNA gets incorporated into the host cell's DNA and directs the infected cells to produce daughter viruses.</li>
<li>The macrophages continue to produce virus that enters the helper T-lymphocytes.</li>
<li>Thus the number of helper T-lymphocytes progressively decreases in the body and weaken the immune system.</li>
<li>Even infections which could be overcome easily start aggravating.</li></ul>
